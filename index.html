    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The 1936 Pittsburgh Flood was a really big event in Pittsburgh’s history, which had a huge impact on people. After looking at photos from the archive, I saw how the flood changed the daily life of people, and how much damage was done to the city because of this flood. These pictures are more than just simple photos. They give us a firsthand look at the flood and show the human side of the disaster. In the pictures, I saw people being worried, streets completely submerged in water, and a lot of effort from first responders and others trying to help. In this essay, based on these photos, I’ll discuss what happened during the flood, why it’s important, and what lessons we can take from it so that we can be better prepared in the future and work to prevent something similar.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I chose photos from the archives that show the 1936 Pittsburgh Flood, which is also referred to as the “St. Patrick’s Day Flood” because it happened in March, which also has St. Patrick’s Day. The flood occurred after heavy rains combined with melting snow, which caused the rivers to overflow and flood many parts of the city. The photos show the streets of Pittsburgh completely filled with water, so much so that in some pictures, people are using boats to get around. Some photos show buildings collapsing because of the pressure of the water, and other pictures focus on people helping each other stay safe and survive. These images give us a better understanding of how big of an event it was and how much of the city was affected. By looking at these photos, it made me think about how just one event can completely change the lives of people in such a small amount of time.</p>

    <h2>What This Means</h2>
    <p>The 1936 Pittsburgh Flood was more than just any other event. It became a huge part of the city’s history. The photos show the flood, but they also show the effort of the people of Pittsburgh to get past it and survive. Some photographs looked like they were taken by professionals, and others seem to have been taken by everyday people. These photos include streets being submerged, businesses being destroyed, and families being broken apart. These images show how the city responded to an alarming event like this flood. The flood forced the city to rethink its infrastructure and design and make changes to prevent such disasters from happening again. The photos also give us a glimpse into life in Pittsburgh at the time, showing how people dressed, what the city looked like, and how the community came together during this difficult time.</p>

  <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">

    <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
    <p>This photo collection is important because it shows a unique and special perspective on how cities are affected by natural disasters and how communities respond. The damage shown in the images is a reminder of the power of nature and the need for cities to be prepared for events like this flood. By looking at these photos, researchers can learn more about the challenges Pittsburgh faced and how the city worked to recover. These photos can be used by historians, city planners, and even scientists to understand the impacts of the flood. The lessons learned from this event are still relevant today, as cities continue to face threats from natural disasters.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">

    <h2>Now What?</h2>
    <p>The photos from the flood show the need for attention to flood prevention and disaster preparedness. They make us ask important questions about how well we are prepared for future floods or similar events. The flood control measures put in place after 1936 helped reduce the risk of future floods, but these policies need to be regularly reviewed and updated. By studying the flood using the photos and other records, we can develop better strategies for dealing with natural disasters today. City officials should invest in better infrastructure, stronger flood defenses, and improved warning systems to protect the city from future flooding. These records can also help teach people the importance of being ready for emergencies and working together during crises. The photos remind us that we can always learn from the past and that we must be prepared so that if something like this happens again in the future, we can handle it much better.</p>
